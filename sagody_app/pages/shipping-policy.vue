            <strong>PRODUCTION (TIMES):</strong>
          </p>

          <p>Keep in mind that we order on demand. On average, merchandise is produced and shipped from our facility 2-4 business days after purchase. Standard shipping/transit times apply (5-8 days for domestic and 7-14 days for international).</p>

          <p>Keep in mind that all&nbsp;our items are created manually. Therefor it can be that the end product you’ll receive can slightly differ from our product photos. Please allow slight differences lining up at the seam since&nbsp;It’s not possible to perfectly align patterns or images from front to back.</p>

          >The time I need to prepare an order for shipping varies. For details:</p>

          <p>I’ll do my best to meet these shipping estimates, but cannot guarantee them. Actual delivery time will depend on the shipping method you choose.</p>
